# Credits

Credits to Mr.Music from Adobe Stock for providing the background image.

I took inspiration from https://github.com/KupoDupo/CMPM-121-D1-Incremental-Game (kupodupo) to add an image background that fits the overall theme or vibe of the game to the webpage rather than a solid color.

I took inspiration from https://github.com/ivli18/CMPM121-D1 (ivli18) to style the clicker button to look more aesthetically pleasing and resemble more of a button to click.
